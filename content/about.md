Hello! I'm Cameron and I'm a Software Developer from the U.K. I find anything Cloud or IoT pretty interseting. Mostly write Golang but also enjoy other language. 

I'm attempting to keep up a semi regular tech blog that consists of some tutorials/ramblings about whatever new tech I'm playing with at the time. If there's anything you think I should check out or want to leave any feedback drop by the [contact page](/contact/)

Thanks for reading!
